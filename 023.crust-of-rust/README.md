# Crust of Rust

In this series we seek to understand intermediate Rust concepts by diving into real examples and working code, 

often by re-implementing functionality from the standard library. 

These episodes are not targeted at newcomers to Rust,

but at those who have read The Book and have the theoretical knowledge,

but want to see how these concepts translate into real use.
